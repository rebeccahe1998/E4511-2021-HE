Columbia IEOR4511 - Drug Discovery (SLC6A3)
This protein is the target of psychomotor stimulants such as amphetamines or cocaine.

SLC6A3 (Solute Carrier Family 6 Member 3) is a Protein Coding gene. Diseases associated with SLC6A3 include Parkinsonism-Dystonia, Tobacco Addiction. 


This gene encodes a dopamine transporter which is a member of the sodium- and chloride-dependent neurotransmitter transporter family. The 3' UTR of this gene contains a 40 bp tandem repeat, referred to as a variable number tandem repeat or VNTR, which can be present in 3 to 11 copies. Variation in the number of repeats is associated with idiopathic epilepsy, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, dependence on alcohol and cocaine, susceptibility to Parkinson disease and protection against nicotine dependence.[provided by RefSeq, Nov 2009]
